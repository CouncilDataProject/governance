# Digital Infrastructure Incubator Notes

This folder keeps notes, learnings, ideas, and more, that we (@nniiicc and @JacksonMaxfield) took from Code for Science and Society's [Digital Infrastructure Incubator](https://incubator.codeforscience.org/)

We plan on building out these documents as a sort of "potential best practices" for growing, governing, and sustaining, civic infrastructure based public interest technology projects.

You can find our original application materials to the program in our [research repository](https://github.com/CouncilDataProject/research/blob/main/grant-applications/2021-css-digital-infrastructure-incubator.md).

## Changes

Think of this like a changelog but for our own governance practices. [Changes](./changes.md)
