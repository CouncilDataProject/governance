# Changes

This is a rough list for now. This will be cleaned up into a higher level summary of "potential changes you should consider as you grow you project."

## Pre-Incubator

- Every-other-week full team meetings
- Individual / small project meetings as needed
- Hard to onboard individuals to the project as they typically all went through one person
- Really only had one "main" project (the whole application)

## Month One

Set a goal for ourselves of restructuring the team a bit to allow more ownership of various sub-projects.

- KEEP: Every-other-week full team meetings
  - Write and distribute meeting agenda before meetings + allow others to add to agenda
- ADD: Write meeting minutes / keep a record of the meeting as a summary
  - We additionally started recording and archiving our team meetings with our own tools
- PROGRESS: Begin process of determining project groups
  - Internally we are calling these "feature-crews"

## Month Two

Start a discussion based on: "What would you want to be talking or leading development of in three months time?"

- KEEP: Every-other-week full team meetings
  - Write and distribute meeting agenda before meetings + allow others to add to agenda
- KEEP: Write meeting minutes / keep a record of the meeting as a summary
  - We additionally started recording and archiving our team meetings with our own tools
- ADD: Feature-crew meetings
  - Team members pick the projects they are most interested in working on
- PROGRESS: Onboarding becomes easier because we can direct newcomers to specific feature-crews
  that need help, or to a feature-crew they are most interested in.
  - This naturally helps distribute "ownership" of the project.
    Whoever is working on design for a feature might onboard a new designer,
    whoever is working on backend development for a feature might onboard a new backend dev, etc.

**Note:** With the addition of feature-crews, there is less "need" for a full team meeting every-other week.
Struggling to figure out how to lead those meetings now.
